# Envis
A tool that allows users to create lists of applications that can be started and stopped with the click of a button.

For example, if a user utilizes Google Chrome, Pycharm, and Git-Bash, all three can be added to an environment and simultaneously controlled.

**Note:** *Although this program launches and terminates external applications, it is not malicious. I have made the source code easy to read so that you can see for yourself that it is safe.*
